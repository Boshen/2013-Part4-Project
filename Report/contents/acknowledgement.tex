\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr Andrea Raith and Olga Perederieieva from the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Auckland,
for their patient guidance, assistance and useful critiques throughout this project, and spending time to correct \emph{all} my spelling and grammar mistakes.

I would also like to thank my fellow part IV students, especially Danny Tsai for his insightful ideas and kind helps.
